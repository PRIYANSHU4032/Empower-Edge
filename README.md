*   Admin Controls: Authorized administrators have full control over employee profiles enabling them to modify details assign roles and manage access rights.
*   Task Assignment: Admins can assign tasks to employees specifying deadlines priorities and task descriptions. Employees can view their assigned tasks and update their status accordingly.
*   Client Interaction: The system facilitates seamless communication with clients by providing tools for managing client contacts scheduling meetings tracking interactions and storing relevant documentation.
*   Security and Access Control: Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions within the system. Encryption and secure authentication mechanisms protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
*   Reporting and Analytics: The system offers reporting and analytics features to track employee performance monitor task completion rates and generate insights for informed decision-making.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone the Repository:</p>

```
git clone 
```

<p>2. Import Project:</p>

```
Import the backend project into your preferred IDE (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA Eclipse).
```

<p>3. Configure Database:</p>

```
Configure the database connection settings in the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory. Update the database URL username and password as per your MySQL configuration.
```

<p>4. Build and Run:</p>

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

<p>5. Verify Backend Setup:</p>

```
Access the backend API endpoints using a tool like Postman to ensure that the application is running correctly. Test CRUD operations and authentication endpoints as needed.
```

<p>6. Navigate to Frontend Directory:</p>

```
cd frontend
```

<p>7. Install Dependencies:</p>

```
npm install
```

<p>8. Configure Backend URL:</p>

```
Update the backend URL in the frontend codebase to point to your locally running backend server. This usually involves modifying a configuration file (e.g. config.js constants.js) to specify the backend API base URL.
```

<p>9. Build Frontend:</p>

```
npm run build
```

<p>10. Serve Frontend:</p>

```
npm start
```

<p>11. Access Application:</p>

```
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the frontend is served (e.g. http://localhost:3000). You should see the Employee Management System interface.
```

<p>12. Create Database Schema:</p>

```
Using a MySQL client (e.g. MySQL Workbench phpMyAdmin) create a new database schema for the Employee Management System.
```

<p>13. Run Database Migrations:</p>

```
If the backend application uses database migrations (e.g. with Flyway or Liquibase) run the migrations to create the necessary tables and schema in the database.
```
